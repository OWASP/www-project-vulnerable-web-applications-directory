# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We will provide security updates for the current release version of this project. Anything else will not receive security updates.

| Version   | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| `master`    | ✅ |
| `Anything else` | ❌ (Unsupported) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. Open a **private/draft security advisory** on GitHub.
2. Provide a **detailed description** of the vulnerability, including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)
3. We will acknowledge your report as quickly as possible and provide a timeline for a fix.
4. Once the vulnerability is fixed, we may publicly disclose it (with credit to you, if desired).

## Security Best Practices for Contributors
- Avoid using user-controlled input directly in shell commands or workflows.
- Follow the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) for secure coding practices.
- Report any suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities immediately.

## Recognition
Security researchers and contributors who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be **publicly acknowledged** in our release notes (unless anonymity is requested).
