# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We actively monitor and provide security updates for the latest stable version of this project. Older versions may not receive security updates.

| Version   | Supported          |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `main`    | ✅                 |
| `< 1.0.0` | ❌ (Unsupported)   |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email the maintainers** at [maintainer-email@example.com] (or open a **private/draft security advisory** on GitHub if available).
2. Provide a **detailed description** of the vulnerability, including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)
3. We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a timeline for a fix.
4. Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will **publicly disclose** it (with credit to you, if desired).

## Security Best Practices for Contributors
- Avoid using user-controlled input directly in shell commands or workflows.
- Follow the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) for secure coding practices.
- Report any suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities immediately.

## Recognition
Security researchers and contributors who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be **publicly acknowledged** in our release notes (unless anonymity is requested).

### How to Submit Your `SECURITY.md` Contribution
1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2. **Add the `SECURITY.md` file** to the root directory.
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** with a clear title and description, e.g.:
   > "feat: Add SECURITY.md to document vulnerability reporting process"
4. **Engage with maintainers** to address any feedback.

### **Why This Matters**
- **For the Project:**
  A `SECURITY.md` file provides **clarity** for researchers and contributors, encourages <followup encodedFollowup="%7B%22id%22%3A%22d5961a36-39fd-406f-8bca-b7bb6e9f076d%22%2C%22snippet%22%3A%22responsible%20disclosure%22%2C%22question%22%3A%22What%20are%20the%20key%20principles%20of%20responsible%20disclosure%20that%20should%20be%20included%20in%20a%20%60SECURITY.md%60%20file%3F%22%7D" />, and demonstrates the project’s commitment to security.
- **For You:**
  This is a **<followup encodedFollowup="%7B%22id%22%3A%22731977ef-ca5b-431e-ba45-4a7269a54453%22%2C%22snippet%22%3A%22high-impact%2C%20low-effort%20contribution%22%2C%22question%22%3A%22What%20are%20other%20examples%20of%20high-impact%2C%20low-effort%20contributions%20I%20can%20make%20to%20open-source%20security%20projects%3F%22%7D" />** that will be valued by the OWASP community. It also complements your vulnerability report by showing a <followup encodedFollowup="%7B%22id%22%3A%22887dae18-308b-46c4-a3c6-8377e9189a6c%22%2C%22snippet%22%3A%22holistic%20approach%20to%20improving%20security%22%2C%22question%22%3A%22What%20other%20elements%20should%20a%20comprehensive%20security%20strategy%20for%20an%20open-source%20project%20include%3F%22%7D" />.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Submit your vulnerability report** (as previously discussed).
2. **Open a separate issue or PR** to add the `SECURITY.md` file.
3. **Reference your vulnerability report** in the PR to show how the policy would have helped.
