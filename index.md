<p>The OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory (VWAD) Project is a comprehensive and well maintained registry of all known vulnerable web applications currently available. These vulnerable web applications can be used by web developers, security auditors and penetration testers to put in practice their knowledge and skills during training sessions (and especially afterwards), as well as to test at any time the multiple hacking tools and offensive techniques available, in preparation for their next real-world engagement.</p>

<p>The vulnerable web applications have been classified in three categories: On-Line, Off-Line, and VMs/ISOs. Each list has been ordered alphabetically.</p>

# Road Map and Getting Involved

As of March 5, 2014, all known Vulnerable Web Applications have been
included.

Going forward the plan is to:

  - Keep publicising
  - Keep up to date with any new apps released or updated
  - Review every 6 months to see if it could be improved in any way

Involvement in the development and promotion of the OWASP Vulnerable Web
Applications Directory Project is actively encouraged\!

You do not have to be a security expert in order to contribute.

Some of the ways you can help:

  - Update the wiki with any missing apps
  - Send pull requests to <https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-VWAD>
